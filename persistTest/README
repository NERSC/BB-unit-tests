The jobs in this directory are chained.

You should only run sbatch ./persistentRequest.sh
usePers.sh will run after persistentRequest completes.
deletePersistent.sh will run after usePers completes.
Each will output its pass/fail conditions in the job script.

NOTE: THERE IS A KNOWN BUG THAT WILL PREVENTS persistentRequest.sh
FROM COMPLETING. YOU WILL NEED TO MANUALLY RUN usePers.sh.
